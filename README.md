# TempleOS UTM configuration for M1 Mac

Since I had issues with screen scaling and sound using TempleOS on QEMU, I tried UTM and it eventually worked.
Although there is probably a way to get it working since UTM is just a GUI wrapper of QEMU.

## Usage

1. Install [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/)
1. Import `TempleOS.utm`
1. Optionally, reinstall from `TempleOS_LiveCD.iso` (once TempleOS tells you to reboot, shut down the VM and eject the ISO)
1. Start the VM
1. Select `C` or `D` drive to boot from
1. Enjoy
